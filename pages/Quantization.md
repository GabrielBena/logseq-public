- The goal here is to present a short overview of different papers regarding quantization in both #SNN and #ANN. Ideally, that'd lead to a more structured synthesis down the line.

- # Literature Review:
	- ## [[@Quantization and Training of Neural Networks for Efficient Integer-Arithmetic-Only Inference]] :
		- ### Main Findings / Summary :
			- Quantization Scheme (affine mapping)
			- Quantization framework  for training (simulated quantization)
			- Quant-aware training helps to keep accuracies close to original, and contribute in advancing the latency-acc tradeoff.
	- ## [[@Quantizing deep convolutional networks for efficient inference: A whitepaper]]:
		- ### Main Findings / Summary:
			- Quantizing weights and activations to 8-bits post-training can produce classification accuracies within 2% of floating point networks for a wide variety of CNN architectures.
			- Model sizes can be reduced by a factor of 4 by quantizing weights to 8 bits, even when 8-bit arithmetic is not supported.
			- Quantization-aware training can further reduce the gap to floating point to 1% at 8-bit precision and allows for reducing the precision of weights to four bits with accuracy losses ranging from 2% to 10%.
		- ### Limitations:
			- The accuracy losses ranging from 2% to 10% with higher accuracy drop for smaller networks when reducing the precision of weights to four bits.
			- The need for further research to enhance the automated quantization tool to enable better quantization of networks.|
	- ## [[@Quantizing Spiking Neural Networks with Integers]]:
		- ### Main Findings / Summary:
			- Developing low-power SNNs is crucial for autonomous agents; SNNs trained with reduced precision can significantly reduce memory usage by ~73% with minimal test error increase.
		- ### Limitations:
			- Need for further study on the interaction and trade-offs in the context of SNNs
			- The active areas of investigation regarding the effects of restricting the temporal dynamics in SNNs to forms that are amenable to efficient-digital hardware
			- The requirement for further investigations to better understand the complex trade-offs
			- The impact of computing neural dynamics at reduced precision on SNN performance, while the precision with which error, gradient, and local classifier calculations are performed had mostly marginal effects
