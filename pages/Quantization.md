- The goal here is to present a short overview of different papers regarding quantization in both #SNN and #ANN. Ideally, that'd lead to a more structured synthesis down the line.
- # Literature Review:
	- ## [[@Quantization and Training of Neural Networks for Efficient Integer-Arithmetic-Only Inference]] :
		- ### Main Findings / Summary :
			- Quantization Scheme (affine mapping)
			- Quantization framework  for training (simulated quantization)
			- Quant-aware training helps to keep accuracies close to original, and contribute in advancing the latency-acc tradeoff.
