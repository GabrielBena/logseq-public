- We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that Leniabreeder offers a powerful solution for discovering self-organizing patterns. The effectiveness of unsupervised Quality-Diversity methods combined with the rich landscape of Lenia exhibits a sustained generation of diversity and complexity characteristic of biological evolution. We provide empirical evidence that suggests unbounded diversity and argue that Leniabreeder is a step towards replicating open-ended evolution in silico
