# Quick comments on Maxence's Paper:
	- ![ALIFE_2024___Leniabreeder.pdf](../assets/ALIFE_2024_Leniabreeder_1712749909943_0.pdf)
	- In the end the langage is relatively humble : "suggests, **some** characterisctics, step toward" so good I think
	- ((66167e8e-ac8f-4ccf-a6b5-d51a55ebd7ae)) : you use this phrase twice, but it's unclear what it means in this context
	- ((66167fae-dca3-4bb9-a003-96a4ca20d459)) : does that mean each phenotype needs to be reclassifies at every step ? And thus is not pitted against the same others if the descriptor changes.
	- ((66167fe5-03fc-4ea5-9b1b-20221ea585aa)): This feels like it's super important but os hard to understand.
