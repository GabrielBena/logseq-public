# Quick comments on Maxence's Paper:
	- ![ALIFE_2024___Leniabreeder.pdf](../assets/ALIFE_2024_Leniabreeder_1712749909943_0.pdf)
	- In the end the langage is relatively humble : "suggests, **some** characterisctics, step toward" so good I think
	- ((66167e8e-ac8f-4ccf-a6b5-d51a55ebd7ae)) : you use this phrase twice, but it's unclear what it means in this context
	- ((66167fae-dca3-4bb9-a003-96a4ca20d459)) : does that mean each phenotype needs to be reclassifies at every step ? And thus is not pitted against the same others if the descriptor changes.
	- ((66167fe5-03fc-4ea5-9b1b-20221ea585aa)): This feels like it's super important but is hard to understand.  Realignment is cool but vague ? Maybe one more sentence to make it clearer could help
	- ((6616803c-2f45-4400-ab9a-af66428c8199)): La classe de caler Ã§a mdr
	- ((6616806c-3c30-44ae-b34a-bdd14f3ec32f)) : Unclear ? Isn't evolution all about survival ?
	- ((661681c1-4b1d-4159-9ff3-e863f25f4579)): A clear (and potentially algortithlmic) definition of solitons would be needed here
	- ((6616828d-63fb-46fb-b42b-26c800cbba1a)): Obvious but say that this is a reconstructions loss
	- ((66168304-c846-4246-9c80-80f9ec92a470)): Nice to mention this, maybe mention how it could be solved ?
